I'm wondering what your guys' thoughts are, a super dumbed down explanation and examples would be great\n\nSay we have a composite key of {id and name_id} or a composite key of {id and first_name} (not sure if it'll make a big difference if one of the columns are not strictly unique like first_name)\n\nIn what scenario / example would I choose a composite primary key over having a single primary key?\n\nSome post says that we no longer use composite keys / 'old practice', for example:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5260589/under-what-condition-we-need-to-use-composite-keys-in-database\n\nAnd I found some posts that suggest composite keys offer better performance such as indexing and joins, for example:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/963809/should-i-use-composite-primary-keys-or-not\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n"
