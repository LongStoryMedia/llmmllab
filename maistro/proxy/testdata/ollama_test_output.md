Okay, the user wants to modify their PostgreSQL table `memories` by adding a new `serial` column as the primary key and removing the existing compound primary key. Let me think through the steps.

First, the existing table has a compound primary key on `(source, source_id, created_at)`. The goal is to replace that with a single `id` column of type `serial`. 

But in PostgreSQL, you can't directly drop a primary key and add a new one in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement. So the steps would involve:

1. **Adding the new `id` column**: Since the existing rows need to have this column populated, I need to set a default value. However, `serial` is a pseudo-type that automatically generates values via a sequence. But if I just add the column with `SERIAL`, PostgreSQL will handle the sequence, but I need to make sure existing rows get assigned values.

Wait, when you add a `SERIAL` column to an existing table, PostgreSQL doesn't automatically populate existing rows. The `SERIAL` type uses a sequence, but the default is set to `nextval('sequence_name')`. However, if you add the column without a default, existing rows will have NULLs. So I need to set a default or manually assign values.

But the user wants the `id` to be incremented for all existing rows. So maybe I need to add the column with a default, but since `SERIAL` is a sequence, perhaps I should create the sequence first and then add the column with a default.

Alternatively, I can add the column as `INT` with a default from a sequence, then set it as the primary key. But the user wants `SERIAL`, which is a shorthand for creating the sequence.

So steps:

1. **Add the `id` column with `SERIAL`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id SERIAL;
   ```
   However, this will not populate existing rows. The `SERIAL` type sets the default to `nextval('sequence')`, but existing rows will have `NULL` unless the column is marked `NOT NULL` and has a default.

Wait, the `SERIAL` type automatically adds a `NOT NULL` constraint and a default. So if I run `ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id SERIAL;`, the column will be `NOT NULL` with a default of `nextval(...)`. But when you add the column, PostgreSQL will assign the next value from the sequence to all existing rows? No, that's not how it works. The default is only applied when inserting new rows. Existing rows will have `NULL` unless the column is `NOT NULL` and has a default. But in this case, the `SERIAL` adds a default, so existing rows would have `NULL` because the default is not applied to existing rows. Wait, no—when you add a column with a default, PostgreSQL will update existing rows to set the column to the default value. But for `SERIAL`, the default is a function call (`nextval('...')`), which might not be evaluated for existing rows.

This is a critical point. If I add the `id` column with `SERIAL`, the existing rows might not get assigned an `id` because the default is a function that's only evaluated on insert. So the existing rows would have `NULL` in the `id` column, which violates the `NOT NULL` constraint.

So to handle this, I need to:

1. **Add the `id` column as `INT` with `NOT NULL` and a default**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
   ```
   But this doesn't help with the sequence. Alternatively, create a sequence and set the default to `nextval('sequence_name')`, but that might not work for existing rows.

Alternatively, add the column as `INT` without a default, then populate it with a sequence:

2. **Create a sequence**:
   ```sql
   CREATE SEQUENCE memories_id_seq;
   ```

3. **Add the `id` column as `INT`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT;
   ```

4. **Populate existing rows with sequence values**:
   ```sql
   WITH cte AS (
     SELECT id, nextval('memories_id_seq') AS new_id
     FROM memories
   )
   UPDATE memories
   SET id = cte.new_id
   FROM cte
   WHERE memories.id = cte.id;
   ```
   Wait, but this requires a column to join on. Since the `id` is being added, this approach might not work. Alternatively, use a temporary column or a counter.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to:

- Add the `id` column as `SERIAL` (which adds a sequence and default), but then update existing rows to set the `id` using the sequence. However, the default is only for new rows. So existing rows would have `NULL`, which would cause an error if the column is `NOT NULL`.

So the correct steps would be:

1. **Add the `id` column as `SERIAL`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id SERIAL;
   ```
   But this might leave existing rows with `NULL` if the default isn't applied. Wait, no—when you add a `SERIAL` column, PostgreSQL creates a sequence and sets the default to `nextval('sequence')`. However, this default is only used for new rows. Existing rows will have `NULL` unless the column is `NOT NULL` and the default is applied. But since `SERIAL` adds `NOT NULL`, the existing rows would have `NULL`, which is invalid.

So this approach would fail. Therefore, the correct way is to:

1. **Add the `id` column as `INT` with `NOT NULL` and a default**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL;
   ```
   But without a default, this would fail. So create a sequence and set the default to `nextval('sequence')`:
   ```sql
   CREATE SEQUENCE memories_id_seq;
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('memories_id_seq');
   ```
   However, this will only apply the default to new rows. Existing rows will still have `NULL` because the default is not applied to existing rows. So this doesn't solve the problem.

Alternative approach:

1. **Add the `id` column as `INT` without `NOT NULL`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT;
   ```

2. **Create a sequence**:
   ```sql
   CREATE SEQUENCE memories_id_seq;
   ```

3. **Populate the `id` column for existing rows**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE memories
   SET id = nextval('memories_id_seq');
   ```

4. **Set the `id` column to `NOT NULL`**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ALTER COLUMN id SET NOT NULL;
   ```

5. **Set the `id` as the primary key**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
   ```

6. **Drop the old primary key**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE memories DROP CONSTRAINT memories_pkey;
   ```

But wait, the original primary key is on `(source, source_id, created_at)`. So I need to drop that constraint. The name of the constraint might be something like `memories_pkey`, but if it's not named explicitly, PostgreSQL assigns a default name. So the user might need to check the constraint name or use `ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT` with the correct name.

Putting it all together, the steps would be:

- Add the new `id` column as `INT` (without `NOT NULL` initially).
- Create a sequence.
- Populate the `id` column for existing rows using the sequence.
- Make the `id` column `NOT NULL`.
- Add the primary key constraint on `id`.
- Drop the old compound primary key.

This ensures that all existing rows get an `id` value, and the new primary key is set correctly.

To replace the compound primary key `(source, source_id, created_at)` with a new `serial` column `id` in your `memories` table, follow these steps:

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

#### 1. **Add the `id` column as an `INT` (not `SERIAL` yet)**
```sql
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT;
```

#### 2. **Create a sequence for the `id` column**
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE memories_id_seq;
```

#### 3. **Populate the `id` column for existing rows**
```sql
UPDATE memories
SET id = nextval('memories_id_seq');
```

#### 4. **Make the `id` column `NOT NULL`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE memories ALTER COLUMN id SET NOT NULL;
```

#### 5. **Add the `id` as the primary key**
```sql
ALTER TABLE memories ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
```

#### 6. **Drop the old compound primary key**
```sql
ALTER TABLE memories DROP CONSTRAINT memories_pkey;
```

---

### **Why This Works**
- **Step 1–3**: Manually assign unique `id` values to all existing rows using a sequence.
- **Step 4**: Ensure the `id` column is not null.
- **Step 5**: Set the new `id` as the primary key.
- **Step 6**: Remove the old compound primary key constraint.

---

### **Optional: Clean Up**
If you want the `id` to auto-increment in the future (e.g., for new rows), you can set the sequence to start at the next value:
```sql
SELECT setval('memories_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM memories));
```

---

### **Example**
```sql
-- 1. Add the id column
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN id INT;

-- 2. Create a sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE memories_id_seq;

-- 3. Populate existing rows
UPDATE memories
SET id = nextval('memories_id_seq');

-- 4. Make id NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE memories ALTER COLUMN id SET NOT NULL;

-- 5. Add primary key
ALTER TABLE memories ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);

-- 6. Drop the old compound primary key
ALTER TABLE memories DROP CONSTRAINT memories_pkey;
```

---

### **Notes**
- Replace `memories_pkey` with the actual constraint name if it differs (check via `\d+ memories` in `psql`).
- This approach avoids issues with `SERIAL` not populating existing rows.
