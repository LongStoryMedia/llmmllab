# Protocol Buffers Type Import Solution

## Problem Summary

We've identified that the Protocol Buffer generated Python files correctly define message types like `ChatReq`, `EmbeddingReq`, and `Message`, but they don't always export these types in a way that's recognizable to IDEs and static type checkers.

Key findings:

1. **Runtime vs Static Analysis Discrepancy**: The types are properly available at runtime but static analysis tools and IDEs don't recognize them.
2. **Import Statements**: We fixed import statements using relative imports (`from . import module_pb2`) which resolved runtime issues.
3. **Type Recognition**: IDEs still can't recognize these types even though they exist at runtime, leading to false error highlighting and poor autocomplete.

## Solution

Our solution consists of two main parts:

### 1. Ensure Correct Runtime Behavior

The previously implemented fixes ensure that Python imports work correctly at runtime:

- Relative imports in the generated `_pb2.py` and `_pb2_grpc.py` files
- Proper `__init__.py` files that import all necessary modules

### 2. Add Type Stub Files for IDE Support

We've created a script `generate_proto_stubs.py` that creates type stub files (`.pyi`) for each protobuf module. These stub files tell IDEs and type checkers about the types defined in the protobuf modules.

## Usage Instructions

### Importing and Using Types

After generating protobuf code, you can import and use the types like this:

```python
# Import the modules
from inference.protos import chat_req_pb2
from inference.protos import embedding_req_pb2
from inference.protos import chat_message_pb2

# Create instances
chat_message = chat_message_pb2.Message(
    role="user",
    content="Hello, world!"
)

chat_request = chat_req_pb2.ChatReq(
    model="model_name",
    messages=[chat_message],
    stream=True
)

embedding_request = embedding_req_pb2.EmbeddingReq(
    model="embedding_model",
    input=["Text to embed"],
    truncate=True
)
```

### Generating Type Stubs for IDE Support

After regenerating proto files with `protogen.py`, run:

```bash
python generate_proto_stubs.py
```

This will create `.pyi` stub files that help IDEs recognize the generated types.

### Example Client

A comprehensive example client demonstrating both chat and embedding functionality is available in `grpc_client_demo.py`.

## Testing

We've confirmed that the types work correctly at runtime through several test scripts:

1. `test_proto_types.py`: Verifies that the types exist and can be instantiated.
2. `test_proto_structure.py`: Examines the internal structure of the proto modules.
3. `embedding_client_example.py`: Demonstrates creating an EmbeddingReq instance.
4. `grpc_client_demo.py`: A full example client for both chat and embedding services.

## Conclusions

1. The gRPC code generation process doesn't expose types in a way that's easily discoverable by IDEs.
2. Our manual fixes to imports resolve runtime issues.
3. Type stub files (.pyi) solve the IDE recognition problem.
4. All proto message types are properly defined and usable despite IDE warnings.

With these solutions in place, developers can use the generated protobuf types without IDE errors or runtime issues.
